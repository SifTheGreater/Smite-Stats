# Smite-Stats
Here is the code I used for doing an analysis of the base stats for the gods in the video game smite.

The first task was to get the raw data, I started to extract the data from the website https://smite.gamepedia.com/Smite_Wiki, were you can get the base stats for each god

I then take this raw data in and so some basic viualisation on it.

Project has been shelved as a better solution to screen scraping was found, project now part of Smite_Analysis

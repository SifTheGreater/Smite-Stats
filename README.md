# Smite-Stats
Here is the code I used for doing an analysis of the base stats for the gods in the video game smite.

The first task was to get the raw data, I started to extract the data from the website https://smite.gamepedia.com/Smite_Wiki, were you can get the base stats fro each god, later I may return here to get the ability info. (21/09/2020)
Finished Extracting the data and cleaned it a little, now there is an excel with all the stats available, will move onto basic analysis and observation later. (22/09/2020)

Added basic code to create stats for multiple levels and some basic data visualistaion (5/10/2020)
